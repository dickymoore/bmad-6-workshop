### Story Quality Validation Checklist
- ✓ Overview clearly ties to PRD goals — Story links persistence scaffold to FR12–FR15 and architecture stack (Dev Notes, References).  
- ✓ Scope explicitly lists in-scope and out-of-scope — Objectives/Scope section lists both.  
- ✓ Design/services/modules listed — Dev Notes references storage services and data layout; tasks create directories and seed files.  
- ✓ Data models include fields/relationships — Data seed formats and schemas noted in AC5/Dev Notes.  
- ✓ APIs/interfaces specified — Storage interfaces summarized in Dev Notes (read/write/export/import hooks).  
- ✓ NFRs addressed — Performance/reliability/observability called out in Dev Notes.  
- ✓ Dependencies enumerated — Stack versions pinned in AC1/AC4 with citations.  
- ✓ Acceptance criteria atomic/testable — Six ACs mapped to specific outcomes.  
- ✓ Traceability map present — Tasks reference AC numbers; References cite PRD, architecture, tech spec.  
- ✓ Risks/assumptions/questions listed — Dev Notes cover risks (partial writes, missing dirs) with mitigations.
